**Description**: The San Pokédex is a responsive web application built with Tailwind CSS that allows users to explore Pokémon from Generations 1 to 5. Users can search for Pokémon by name or Pokédex number, discover random Pokémon, and view details like their elemental typing, abilities, moves, and locations from various games. The app displays both regular and shiny sprites, shows evolutionary paths (or "N/A" if none exist), and lets users save favorites using local storage. Designed with a clean, modern interface in Figma, it works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, making it easy for trainers to access Pokémon information on the go.
