**Description**: The San Pokédex is a responsive web application built with Tailwind CSS that allows users to explore Pokémon from Generations 1 to 5. Users can search for Pokémon by name or Pokédex number, discover random Pokémon, and view details like their elemental typing, abilities, moves, and locations from various games. The app displays both regular and shiny sprites, shows evolutionary paths (or "N/A" if none exist), and lets users save favorites using local storage. Designed with a clean, modern interface in Figma, it works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, making it easy for trainers to access Pokémon information on the go.

**Review**: overall site looks nice and clean. having moves and abilities on modals is a nice way to eliminate a bunch of text on screen. I think I would prefer having all evolution for tree on screen cuz it may be confusing which evolves to which. indicator for captured/favorited would be nice so I know which I already favorited at a glance rather than having to always click favorites. pokemon like eevee, with multiple evolutions, is not showing other evolutions. overall nice, I think just getting the other evolutions is the main thing.
